#Segue Practice

Segue Practice is a simple app that was written to practice using protocols and delegates to pass data back from a second view controller to the initial view. Each time the button is pressed, the text from the input field is passed to the label in the next view. The initial view has a toggle switch to preserve state and show that the user is returning to that view instead of going to a new instance of the view created from the initial view's class.
